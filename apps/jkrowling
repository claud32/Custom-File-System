Joanne Rowling CH OBE HonFRSE FRCPE FRSL (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/ ROH-ling;[1] born 31 July 1965), also known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She wrote a seven-volume children's fantasy series, Harry Potter, published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 500 million copies, been translated into at least 70 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, as Robert Galbraith.

Born in Yate, Rowling graduated with a degree in French from the University of Exeter in 1987 and began working temp jobs as a bilingual secretary. In 1990, the idea for the characters of Harry Potter came to her while she waited on a delayed train; later that year, her mother died of multiple sclerosis. In the seven years before publication of the first Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997), Rowling moved to Portugal, married, had a daughter, relocated to Scotland when her marriage failed, divorced, and earned a teaching certificate. She wrote while living on state assistance as a single parent, deeply affected by her mother's death. By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.

Rowling concluded the Harry Potter series with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). The novels follow a boy named Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts, a school for wizards, and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences include the Bildungsroman (coming-of-age story), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive. There were also religious debates over Harry Potter.

Rowling has won many accolades for her work. She has been appointed to the Order of the British Empire and made a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy. Harry Potter brought her wealth and recognition that she has used to advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes. She co-founded the charity Lumos and established the Volant Charitable Trust, named after her mother. Rowling's charitable giving centres on medical causes and supporting at-risk women and children. In politics, she has donated to Britain's Labour Party and opposed Scottish independence and Brexit. Since late 2019, she has publicly expressed her opinions on transgender people and related civil rights. These have been criticised as transphobic by LGBT rights organisations and some feminists, but have received support from other feminists and individuals.

Early life and family

Joanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965 at Cottage Hospital in Yate, Gloucestershire.[8][b] Her parents Anne (née Volant) and Peter ("Pete") James Rowling had met the previous year on a train, sharing a trip from King's Cross Station, London, to their naval postings at Arbroath, Scotland. Anne was in the WREN and Pete was with the Royal Navy.[14] They came from middle-class backgrounds;[10] Pete was the son of a machine-tool setter who later opened a grocery shop.[15] They left the navy life and sought a country home to raise the baby they were expecting,[15] and married on 14 March 1965[10] when both were 19.[16] The Rowlings settled in Yate,[17] where Pete started work as an assembly-line production worker at the Bristol Siddeley factory.[15] Pete's company became part of Rolls-Royce,[18] and he worked his way into management as a chartered engineer.[19] Anne later worked as a science technician.[20] Neither Anne nor Pete attended university.[21]

Joanne has a sister, Dianne, two years younger than her.[10] When Joanne was four, the family moved to Winterbourne, Gloucestershire.[16][22] She began at St Michael's Church of England Primary School in Winterbourne when she was five.[10][c] The Rowlings lived near a family called Potter – a name Joanne always liked.[25][d] Anne loved to read and their homes were filled with books.[26] Pete read The Wind in the Willows to his daughters,[27] while Anne introduced them to the animals in Richard Scarry's books.[28] Joanne's first attempt at writing, a story called "Rabbit" composed when she was six, was inspired by Scarry's creatures.[28]

When Rowling was about nine, the family purchased the historic Church Cottage in Tutshill.[29][e] In 1974, Rowling began attending the nearby Church of England School.[33] Biographer Sean Smith describes her teacher Sylvia Morgan as a "battleaxe"[34] who "struck fear into the hearts of the children";[35] she seated Rowling in "dunces' row" after she performed poorly on an arithmetic test.[36][f] In 1975, Rowling joined a Brownies pack. Its special events and parties, and the pack groups (Fairies, Pixies, Sprites, Elves, Gnomes and Imps) provided a magical world away from the stern Morgan.[37] When she was eleven[38] or twelve, she wrote a short story, "The Seven Cursed Diamonds".[39] She later described herself during this period as "the epitome of a bookish child – short and squat, thick National Health glasses, living in a world of complete daydreams".[40]

Secondary school and university

Church Cottage, Rowling's childhood home
Rowling's secondary school was Wyedean School and College, a state school she began attending at the age of eleven[41] and where she was bullied.[42][43] Rowling was inspired by her favourite teacher, Lucy Shepherd, who taught the importance of structure and precision in writing.[44][45] Smith writes that Rowling "craved to play heavy electric guitar",[46] and describes her as "intelligent yet shy".[47] Her teacher Dale Neuschwander was impressed by her imagination.[48] When she was a young teenager, Rowling's great-aunt gave her Hons and Rebels, the autobiography of the civil rights activist Jessica Mitford.[49] Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and she read all her books.[50]

Anne had a strong influence on her daughter.[10] Early in Rowling's life, the support of her mother and sister instilled confidence and enthusiasm for storytelling.[51] Anne was a creative and accomplished cook,[52][g] who helped lead her daughters' Brownie activities,[55] and took a job in the chemistry department at Wyedean while her daughters were there.[20] The three walked to and from school, sharing stories about their day, more like sisters than mother and daughters.[46][56] John Nettleship, the head of science at Wyedean, described Anne as "absolutely brilliant, a sparkling character ... very imaginative".[11]

Anne Rowling was diagnosed with a "virulent strain" of multiple sclerosis when she was 34[57] or 35 and Jo was 15,[58] and had to give up her job.[59] Rowling's home life was complicated by her mother's illness[60] and a strained relationship with her father.[61] Rowling later said "home was a difficult place to be",[62] and that her teenage years were unhappy.[31] In 2020, she wrote that her father would have preferred a son and described herself as having severe obsessive–compulsive disorder in her teens.[63] She began to smoke, took an interest in alternative rock,[57] and adopted Siouxsie Sioux's back-combed hair and black eyeliner.[11] Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia that provided an escape from her difficult home life and the means for Harris and Rowling to broaden their activities.[64][h]

Living in a small town with pressures at home, Rowling became more interested in her school work.[57] Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English".[31] Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B and was named head girl at Wyedean.[67] She applied to Oxford University in 1982 but was rejected.[10] Biographers attribute her rejection to privilege, as she had attended a state school rather than a private one.[68][69]

Rowling always wanted to be a writer,[70] but chose to study French and the classics at the University of Exeter for practical reasons, influenced by her parents who thought job prospects would be better with evidence of bilingualism.[71] She later stated that Exeter was not initially what she expected ("to be among lots of similar people – thinking radical thoughts") but that she enjoyed herself after she met more people like her.[50] She was an average student at Exeter, described by biographers as prioritising her social life over her studies, and lacking ambition and enthusiasm.[72][73] Rowling recalls doing little work at university, preferring to read Dickens and Tolkien.[31] She earned a BA in French from Exeter,[74] graduating in 1987 after a year of study in Paris.[75]

Inspiration and mother's death
After university, Rowling moved to a flat in Clapham Junction with friends,[76] and took a course to become a bilingual secretary.[10] While she was working temp jobs in London, Amnesty International hired her to document human rights issues in French-speaking Africa.[77] She began writing adult novels while working as a temp, although they were never published.[11][78] In 1990, she planned to move with her boyfriend to Manchester,[16] and frequently took long train trips to visit.[38] In mid-1990, she was on a train delayed by four hours from Manchester to London,[79] when the characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger came plainly into her mind.[80] Having no pen or paper allowed her to fully explore the characters and their story in her imagination before she reached her flat and began to write.[79]

Rowling moved to Manchester around November 1990.[50] She described her time in Manchester, where she worked for the Chamber of Commerce[38] and at Manchester University in temp jobs,[81] as a "year of misery".[82] Her mother died of multiple sclerosis on 30 December 1990.[83] At the time, she was writing Harry Potter and had never told her mother about it.[84] Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing.[85] She later said that the Mirror of Erised is about her mother's death,[86] and noted an "evident parallelism" between Harry confronting his own mortality and her life.[87]

The pain of the loss of her mother was compounded when some personal effects her mother had left her were stolen.[50] With the end of the relationship with her boyfriend, and "being made redundant from an office job in Manchester", Rowling described herself as being in a state of "fight or flight".[31] An advertisement in The Guardian led her to move to Porto, Portugal, in November 1991 to teach night classes in English as a foreign language,[88] writing during the day.[31]

Marriage, divorce, and single parenthood

Rowling moved to Porto, Portugal to teach English.
Five months after arriving in Porto, Rowling met the Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found that they shared an interest in Jane Austen.[89] By mid-1992, they were planning a trip to London to introduce Arantes to Rowling's family, when she had a miscarriage.[90] The relationship was troubled, yet they married on 16 October 1992.[91][i] Their daughter Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford[j]) was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal.[11] By this time, Rowling had finished the first three chapters of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone – almost as they were eventually published – and had drafted the rest of the novel.[93]

Rowling experienced domestic abuse during her marriage.[63][94] Arantes said in June 2020 that he had slapped her and did not regret it.[95] Rowling described the marriage as "short and catastrophic".[38] Rowling and Arantes separated on 17 November 1993 after Arantes threw her out of the house; she returned with the police to retrieve Jessica and went into hiding for two weeks before she left Portugal.[11][96] In late 1993, with a draft of Harry Potter in her suitcase,[31] Rowling moved with her daughter to Edinburgh, Scotland,[8] planning to stay with her sister through Christmas.[50]

Her biographer Sean Smith raises the question of why Rowling chose to stay with her sister rather than her father.[97] Rowling has spoken of an estrangement from her father, stating in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that "It wasn't a good relationship from my point of view for a very long time but I had a need to please and I kept that going for a long time and then there ... just came a point at which I had to pull up and say I can't do this anymore."[61] Pete had married his secretary within two years of Anne's death,[98] and The Scotsman reported in 2003 that "[t]he speed of his decision to move in with his secretary ... distressed both sisters and a fault-line now separated them and their father."[11] Rowling said in 2012 that they had not spoken in the last nine years.[31]

Rowling sought government assistance and got £69 (US$103.50) per week from Social Security; not wanting to burden her recently married sister, she moved to a flat that she characterised as mouse-ridden.[99] She later described her economic status as being "poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless".[31] Seven years after graduating from university, she saw herself as a failure.[100] Tison Pugh writes that the "grinding effects of poverty, coupled with her concern for providing for her daughter as a single parent, caused great hardship".[38] Her marriage had failed and she was jobless with a dependent child, but she later described this as "liberating" her to focus on writing.[100] She has said that "Jessica kept me going".[98] Her old school friend, Sean Harris, lent her £600 ($900), which allowed her to move to a flat in Leith,[101] where she finished Philosopher's Stone.[101]

Arantes arrived in Scotland in March 1994 seeking both Rowling and Jessica.[11][102] On 15 March 1994, Rowling sought an action of interdict (order of restraint); the interdict was granted and Arantes returned to Portugal.[11][103] Early in the year, Rowling began to experience a deep depression[104] and sought medical help when she contemplated suicide.[38][k] With nine months of therapy, things gradually improved.[104] She filed for divorce on 10 August 1994[106] and the divorce was finalised on 26 June 1995.[107]

Rowling wanted to finish the book before enrolling in a teacher training course, fearing she might not be able to finish once she started the course.[50] She often wrote in cafés,[108] including Nicolson's, owned in partnership by her brother-in-law.[109] Secretarial work brought in £15 ($22.50) per week, but she would lose government benefits if she earned more.[110] In mid-1995, a friend gave her money that allowed her to come off benefits and enrol full-time in college.[111] Still needing money and expecting to make a living by teaching,[112] Rowling began a teacher training course in August 1995 at Moray House School of Education[113][a] after completing her first novel.[114] She earned her teaching certificate in July 1996[2] and began teaching at Leith Academy.[115] Rowling later said that writing the first Harry Potter book had saved her life and that her concerns about "love, loss, separation, death ... are reflected in the first book".[87]

Publishing Harry Potter

Rowling completed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in June 1995.[116] The initial draft included an illustration of Harry by a fireplace, showing a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.[117] Following an enthusiastic report from an early reader,[118] Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling. Her manuscript was submitted to twelve publishers, all of which rejected it.[11] Barry Cunningham, who ran the children's literature department at Bloomsbury Publishing, bought it,[119] after Nigel Newton, who headed Bloomsbury at the time, saw his eight-year-old daughter finish one chapter and want to keep reading.[38][120] Rowling recalls Cunningham telling her, "You'll never make any money out of children's books, Jo."[121] Rowling was awarded a writer's grant by the Scottish Arts Council[l] to support her childcare costs and finances before Philosopher's Stone's publication, and to aid in writing the sequel, Chamber of Secrets.[122][123] On 26 June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 500 copies.[124][125] Before Chamber of Secrets was published, Rowling had received £2,800 ($4,200) in royalties.[126]

Philosopher's Stone introduces Harry Potter. Harry is a wizard who lives with his non-magical relatives until his eleventh birthday, when he is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[127][128] Rowling wrote six sequels, which follow Harry's adventures at Hogwarts with friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley and his attempts to defeat Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents when he was a child.[127] In Philosopher's Stone, Harry foils Voldemort's plan to acquire an elixir of life; in Deathly Hallows, the final book, he kills Voldemort.[127]

Rowling received the news that the US rights were being auctioned at the Bologna Children's Book Fair.[129] To her surprise and delight, Scholastic Corporation bought the rights for $105,000.[130] She bought a flat in Edinburgh with the money from the sale.[131] Arthur A. Levine, head of the imprint at Scholastic, pushed for a name change. He wanted Harry Potter and the School of Magic; as a compromise Rowling suggested Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.[132] Sorcerer's Stone was released in the United States in September 1998.[133] It was not widely reviewed, but the reviews it received were generally positive.[134] Sorcerer's Stone became a New York Times bestseller by December.[135]

The next three books in the series were released in quick succession between 1998 and 2000: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), each selling millions of copies.[136] When Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had not appeared by 2002, rumours circulated that Rowling was suffering writer's block.[137] It was published in June 2003, selling millions of copies on the first day.[138] Two years later, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released in July, again selling millions of copies on the first day.[139] The series ended with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, published in July 2007.[140]

Films

In 1999, Warner Bros. purchased film rights to the first two Harry Potter novels for a reported $1 million.[141][142] Rowling accepted the offer with the provision that the studio only produce Harry Potter films based on books she authored,[143] while retaining the right to final script approval,[144] and some control over merchandising.[142] Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, an adaptation of the first Harry Potter book, was released in November 2001.[145] Steve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film,[146] with Rowling's assistance, ensuring that his scripts kept to the plots of the novels.[147] The film series concluded with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which was adapted in two parts; part one was released on 19 November 2010,[148] and part two followed on 15 July 2011.[149]

Warner Bros. announced an expanded relationship with Rowling in 2013, including a planned series of films about her character Newt Scamander, fictitious author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.[150] The first film of five, a prequel to the Harry Potter series, set roughly 70 years earlier, was released in November 2016.[151] Rowling wrote the screenplay, which was released as a book.[152] Crimes of Grindelwald was released in November 2018.[153] Secrets of Dumbledore was released in April 2022.[154]

Religion, wealth and remarriage
Further information: Religious debates over the Harry Potter series
By 1998, Rowling was portrayed in the media as a "penniless divorcee hitting the jackpot".[126] According to her biographer Sean Smith, the publicity became effective marketing for Harry Potter.[126] But her journey from living on benefits to wealth brought, along with fame, concerns from parents about the books' portrayals of the occult and gender.[155] Ultimately, Smith says that these concerns served to "increase her public profile rather than damage it".[156]

Rowling identifies as a Christian.[157] Although she grew up next door to her church,[158] accounts of the family's church attendance differ.[m] She began attending a Church of Scotland congregation, where Jessica was christened, around the time she was writing Harry Potter.[160] In a 2012 interview, she said she belonged to the Scottish Episcopal Church.[161] Rowling has stated that she believes in God,[162] but has experienced doubt[163] and that her struggles with faith play a part in her books.[87] She does not believe in magic or witchcraft.[157][162]

Rowling married Neil Murray, a doctor, in 2001.[5] The couple intended to marry in July of that year in the Galapagos; after a leak to the press, they delayed their wedding plans and changed their vacation destination to Mauritius.[164] After the UK Press Complaints Commission ruled that a magazine had breached Jessica's privacy when the eight-year-old was included in a photograph of the family vacationing together,[165][166] Murray and Rowling sought a more private and quiet place to live and work.[167] Rowling purchased Killiechassie House and its estate in Perthshire, Scotland.[168] On 26 December 2001, the couple had a small, private wedding there, officiated by an Episcopalian priest who travelled from Edinburgh.[5] Their son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born in 2003,[169] and their daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray was born in 2005.[170]

In 2004, Forbes named Rowling "the first billion-dollar author".[171] Rowling denied that she was a billionaire in a 2005 interview.[172] By 2012, Forbes concluded she was no longer a billionaire due to her charitable donations and high UK taxes.[173] She was named the world's highest paid author by Forbes in 2008,[174] 2017[175] and 2019.[176] Her UK sales total in excess of £238 million, making her the best-selling living author in Britain.[177] The 2021 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £820 million, ranking her as the 196th-richest person in the UK.[178] As of 2020, she also owns a £4.5 million Georgian house in Kensington and a £2 million home in Edinburgh.[179]

Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith
Main articles: The Casual Vacancy, The Casual Vacancy (miniseries), Cormoran Strike, and Strike (TV series)
In mid-2011, Rowling left Christopher Little Literary Agency and followed her agent Neil Blair to the Blair Partnership. He represented her for the publication of The Casual Vacancy, released in September 2012 by Little, Brown and Company.[180] It was Rowling's first since Harry Potter ended, and her first book for adults.[181] A contemporary take on 19th-century British fiction about village life,[182] Casual Vacancy was promoted as a black comedy,[183] while the critic Ian Parker described it as a "rural comedy of manners".[31] It was adapted to a miniseries co-created by the BBC and HBO.[184]

Little, Brown published The Cuckoo's Calling, the purported début novel of Robert Galbraith, in April 2013.[185] It initially sold 1,500 copies in hardback.[186] After an investigation prompted by discussion on Twitter, the journalist Richard Brooks contacted Rowling's agent, who confirmed Galbraith was Rowling's pseudonym.[186] Rowling later said she enjoyed working as Robert Galbraith,[187] a name she took from Robert F. Kennedy, a personal hero, and Ella Galbraith, a name she invented for herself in childhood.[188] After the revelation, sales of Cuckoo's Calling escalated.[189]

Continuing the Cormoran Strike series of detective novels, The Silkworm was released in 2014;[190] Career of Evil in 2015;[191] Lethal White in 2018;[192] and Troubled Blood in 2020.[193] Cormoran Strike, a disabled veteran of the War in Afghanistan with a prosthetic leg,[194] is unfriendly and sometimes oblivious, but acts with a deep moral sensibility.[195] In 2017, BBC One aired the first episode[196] of the four-season series Strike, a television adaptation of the Cormoran Strike novels starring Tom Burke.[197] The series was picked up by HBO for distribution in the United States and Canada.[198]

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Palace Theatre in the West End
Pottermore, a website with information and stories about characters in the Harry Potter universe, launched in 2011. On its release, Pottermore was rooted in the Harry Potter novels, tracing the series's story in an interactive format. Its brand was associated with Rowling: she introduced the site in a video as a shared media environment to which she and Harry Potter fans would contribute. The site was substantially revised in 2015 to resemble an encyclopedia of Harry Potter. Beyond encyclopedia content, the post-2015 Pottermore included promotions for Warner Bros. films including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.[199][200]

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child premiered in the West End in May 2016[201] and on Broadway in July.[202] At its London premiere, Rowling confirmed that she would not write any more Harry Potter books.[203] Rowling collaborated with writer Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany.[201][202] Cursed Child's script was published as a book in July 2016.[204] The play follows the friendship between Harry's son Albus and Scorpius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy's son, at Hogwarts.[202]

Children's stories
Main articles: The Ickabog and The Christmas Pig
The Ickabog was Rowling's first book aimed at children since Harry Potter.[205] Ickabog is a monster that turns out to be real; a group of children find out the truth about the Ickabog and save the day.[206][207] Rowling released The Ickabog for free online in mid-2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom.[208] She began writing it as early as 2009 but set it aside to focus on other works including Casual Vacancy.[208] Scholastic held a competition to select children's art for the print edition, which was published in the US and Canada on 10 November 2020.[209] Profits went to charities focused on COVID-19 relief.[205][210]

In The Christmas Pig, a young boy loses his favourite stuffed animal, a pig, and the Christmas Pig guides him through the fantastical Land of the Lost to retrieve it.[211] The novel was published on 12 October 2021[212][213] and became a bestseller in the UK[214] and the US.
